# iTunesMetaDataAnalyzer
Sort, display, and visualize iTunes meta data on songs. For example, filter on the ratio of how often you play a song vs skip it.

Export your itunes data into an xml file by going to:
> File -> Library -> Export Library

You can then import this data by running the application and selecting this file when prompted. 

Below is an example animation created with this tool of how a music library changes over time
